# Sales Copilot

AI-powered sales execution system combining proven methodologies with deal intelligence.

## Core Philosophy

**Sales is not convincing. Sales is qualifying.**

The best salespeople:
- Disqualify bad fits early
- Understand the buyer's world deeply
- Create urgency through insight, not pressure
- Make it easy to buy (and easy to say no)

## The Methodology Engine

| Framework | Best For | Core Principle |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Josh Braun** | Cold outreach, early conversations | Detachment sells. Neediness repels. |
| **Chris Voss** | Negotiations, objection handling | Tactical empathy disarms resistance. |
| **Sandler** | Discovery, qualification | Pain drives action. No pain, no sale. |
| **MEDDPICC** | Enterprise deals, forecasting | Rigor prevents happy ears. |
| **Challenger** | Complex sales, differentiation | Teach, don't pitch. |

## Stakeholder Qualification (MEDDPICC)

| Element | Question | Red Flag |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Metrics** | What business outcome are they measuring? | "We just want to improve" (vague) |
| **Economic Buyer** | Who signs the check? | Only talking to users/champions |
| **Decision Criteria** | What are they evaluating on? | "We'll know it when we see it" |
| **Decision Process** | What's the buying process? | "We'll figure it out" |
| **Paper Process** | Legal, procurement, security? | "Should be easy" |
| **Implicate Pain** | What happens if unsolved? | No urgency |
| **Champion** | Who sells internally for you? | No internal advocate |
| **Competition** | Who else? Status quo? | "No one" |

## Deal Stages

| Stage | Exit Criteria |
|-------|---------------|
| **0 - Lead** | Responded to outreach |
| **1 - Discovery** | Pain confirmed, stakeholders identified |
| **2 - Qualification** | MEDDPICC complete, EB access confirmed |
| **3 - Evaluation** | Decision criteria clear, top 2 |
| **4 - Proposal** | Proposal delivered, no new objections |
| **5 - Negotiation** | Verbal yes, paper process started |
| **6 - Closed Won** | Signed |

## Decision Framework

1. **Qualify before you pitch** — Understand before you present
2. **Seek to disqualify** — Bad deals cost more than no deals
3. **Multi-thread always** — Single-threaded = single point of failure
4. **Pain over features** — They buy outcomes, not capabilities
5. **Detachment wins** — Need the deal less than they need the solution
