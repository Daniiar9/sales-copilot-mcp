# Objection Bank

Complete library of B2B objections with methodology-driven responses.

---

## The Framework: L.A.R.P.

**Listen** -> Let them finish
**Acknowledge** -> Show you heard them
**Respond** -> Ask a question or address
**Pivot** -> Move forward or close gracefully

Never overcome objections. Understand them.

## Timing Objections

### "I don't have time right now"

**Acknowledge**: "Totally get it - everyone's stretched."

**Respond**: "What's eating most of your time right now?"

**Pivot**:
- If relevant: "That's actually what this solves. Worth 10 minutes?"
- If not: "When would be better? Or should I close this out?"

---

### "Now's not a good time"

**Acknowledge**: "No worries."

**Respond**: "When would be better - or is this just not a priority?"

**Pivot**: "I'd rather hear no than keep bugging you. What's the honest answer?"

---

### "Call me back in 6 months"

**Acknowledge**: "Sure."

**Respond**: "What will be different in 6 months?"

**Pivot**: "Sometimes '6 months' means 'not interested.' Which is it for you?"

---

## Price Objections

### "It's too expensive"

**Acknowledge**: "Got it."

**Respond**: "Too expensive compared to what?"

**Pivot**:
- If vs. competitor: "What do they offer that we don't?"
- If vs. budget: "What would make this worth the investment?"
- If vs. nothing: "What's the cost of not solving this?"

---

### "I can't afford it"

**Acknowledge**: "Budget is real. I get it."

**Respond**: "Is it cash flow, or is the value not clear yet?"

**Pivot**:
- If cash flow: "Would a payment plan help?"
- If value: "What would I need to show you?"

---

### "Can you do a discount?"

**Acknowledge**: "I hear you."

**Respond**: "How am I supposed to do that?" (makes them justify)

**Pivot**: "This is the investment. Curious - what are you comparing it to?"

---

### "We don't have budget"

**Acknowledge**: "Understood."

**Respond**: "Is there no budget, or is it allocated elsewhere?"

**Pivot**: "If budget weren't an issue, would this be a priority?"

---

## Authority Objections

### "I need to run this by my boss"

**Acknowledge**: "Makes sense."

**Respond**: "What do you think they'll say? What concerns might they have?"

**Pivot**: "Want me to join a call with them?"

---

### "This isn't my decision"

**Acknowledge**: "Understood."

**Respond**: "Who should I be talking to?"

**Pivot**: "Would you be comfortable introducing me?"

---

### "We have a committee that decides"

**Acknowledge**: "Got it."

**Respond**: "Who's on it? What do they each care about?"

**Pivot**: "What would help you champion this to them?"

---

## Trust Objections

### "I've been burned before"

**Acknowledge**: "That sucks. I get the hesitation."

**Respond**: "What happened?"

**Pivot**: "Here's how we're different: [specific]. But if you're not comfortable, no pressure."

---

### "How do I know this works?"

**Acknowledge**: "Fair question."

**Respond**: "What kind of proof would satisfy you?"

**Pivot**: Offer case study, reference call, or trial.

---

### "I've never heard of you"

**Acknowledge**: "Yeah, we're newer/niche."

**Respond**: "What would help you feel comfortable?"

**Pivot**: "Here's a case study in your space."

---

## Interest Objections

### "I'm not interested"

**Acknowledge**: "Totally fine."

**Respond**: "Mind if I ask what made you feel that way?"

**Pivot**: Clarify misunderstanding or close gracefully.

---

### "We're happy with what we have"

**Acknowledge**: "Great to hear."

**Respond**: "What's working well?"

**Pivot**: "Most people have at least one frustration. What's yours?"

---

### "We already have a solution"

**Acknowledge**: "Nice."

**Respond**: "How's that working for you?"

**Pivot**:
- If happy: "Sounds like you're set. If that changes, you know where to find me."
- If frustrated: "What would need to change to consider alternatives?"

---

## Stall Objections

### "I need to think about it"

**Acknowledge**: "Of course."

**Respond**: "What specifically are you weighing?"

**Pivot**: "I'd rather hear no than maybe. What's your gut telling you?"

---

### "Send me more information"

**Acknowledge**: "Sure."

**Respond**: "What specifically would be helpful?"

**Pivot**: "Actually, a 10-minute call would let me tailor it. Would that work?"

---

### "Let me get back to you"

**Acknowledge**: "Sure thing."

**Respond**: "When should I follow up? What would help you decide?"

**Pivot**: "If the answer is no, feel free to tell me now."

---

## Competition Objections

### "We're going with [competitor]"

**Acknowledge**: "Got it."

**Respond**: "Mind if I ask what tipped the decision?"

**Pivot**: "Fair enough. If anything changes, reach out."

---

### "Your competitor is cheaper"

**Acknowledge**: "They probably are."

**Respond**: "What do you get with them vs. us?"

**Pivot**: "If price is the only factor, they might be the fit. But if [value] matters, let's talk."

---

### "Competitor has [feature] you don't"

**Acknowledge**: "That's true."

**Respond**: "How important is that feature to your decision?"

**Pivot**:
- If critical: "They might be a better fit."
- If nice-to-have: "Most customers prioritize [X] over that. What's your priority?"

## The Ultimate Response

When nothing else works:

"It sounds like this might not be for you right now. And that's totally fine. Should I close this out?"

This either:
1. Gets an honest no (saves time)
2. Reopens the conversation
3. Reveals the real objection
