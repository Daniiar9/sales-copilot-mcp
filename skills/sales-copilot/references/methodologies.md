# 1. Josh Braun — Detachment Selling

## Core Principle
**The person who needs the deal less, wins.**

## The 7 Principles

### 1. Be Interested, Not Interesting
Don't pitch. Ask questions.

**Instead of**: "Let me tell you about our platform..."
**Try**: "What's your current approach to [problem]?"

### 2. Make It Safe to Say No
When someone feels trapped, they ghost.

**Try**: "This might not be for you, and that's totally fine."

### 3. Diagnose Before You Prescribe
Spend 70% of calls asking questions.

### 4. Seek to Disqualify
Look for reasons they're NOT a fit.

**Try**: "Most people in your situation aren't ready for this. Are you different?"

### 5. Never Chase, Only Respond
Follow up with value, give easy outs.

### 6. Hold Your Position
Discounting signals desperation.

**Try**: "This is what it costs. If that doesn't work, no worries."

### 7. Care About Them, Not The Sale
Genuinely want what's best — even if it's not you.

## Braun Scripts

**Opening a cold call**:
- ❌ "I was hoping to tell you about our platform..."
- ✅ "I saw [specific thing]. Curious — how are you handling [problem]?"

**When they ghost**:
- ❌ "Just checking in again!"
- ✅ "Want me to close this out? Totally fine if timing's wrong."

**When they ask for a discount**:
- ❌ "Let me see what I can do..."
- ✅ "This is the investment. Curious — what are you comparing it to?"

# 2. Chris Voss — Tactical Empathy

## Core Principle
**Empathy is not agreement. It's understanding.**

## Key Techniques

### 1. Mirroring
Repeat the last 1-3 words they said.

**Them**: "We're struggling with our current vendor."
**You**: "Struggling with your current vendor?"
**Them**: "Yeah, they keep missing deadlines and..." [elaborates]

### 2. Labeling
Name the emotion. Starts with "It seems like..." or "It sounds like..."

**You**: "It sounds like you're frustrated with the lack of visibility."
**Them**: "Exactly!"

### 3. The Accusation Audit
Get ahead of objections by naming them first.

**You**: "You're probably thinking this is just another vendor promising the moon..."

### 4. "That's Right"
Summarize their situation so accurately they say "That's right."

### 5. Calibrated Questions
Open-ended questions starting with "What" or "How" — never "Why."

- "What's the biggest challenge you're facing?"
- "How would you like to see this work?"
- "What happens if you don't solve this?"

### 6. No-Oriented Questions
People prefer saying no to yes.

- Instead of: "Do you have a few minutes?"
- Try: "Is now a bad time?"

# 3. Sandler — Pain Funnel

## Core Principle
**No pain, no sale.**

## The Pain Funnel

### Level 1: Surface Pain
"Tell me more about that..."
"Can you be more specific?"

### Level 2: Business Impact
"How long has this been going on?"
"What have you tried to fix it?"

### Level 3: Personal Impact
"How does that affect you personally?"
"How do you feel about that?"

### Level 4: Quantified Pain
"What's this costing you?"
"What's the cost of doing nothing?"

### Level 5: Commitment
"Is this something you're committed to fixing?"

## The Up-Front Contract

Before every meeting:

> "Here's what I'd like to cover today: [agenda]. By the end, we'll either see there's a fit and agree on next steps, or we'll realize this isn't right and part as friends. Either way works for me. Does that work for you?"

## Sandler Rules

1. "You can't sell anybody anything — they must discover they want it."
2. "Don't spill your candy in the lobby." (Don't give away your solution early)
3. "A prospect who is listening is no prospect at all." (They should talk 70%)

# 4. MEDDPICC — Enterprise Qualification

## Core Principle
**Rigor prevents happy ears.**

## The Framework

| Element | Question | Red Flag |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Metrics** | What business outcome? | "We want to improve" |
| **Economic Buyer** | Who signs the check? | Only talking to users |
| **Decision Criteria** | What are they evaluating? | "We'll know it when we see it" |
| **Decision Process** | What's the buying process? | "We'll figure it out" |
| **Paper Process** | Legal, procurement, security? | "Should be easy" |
| **Implicate Pain** | What if unsolved? | No urgency |
| **Champion** | Who sells internally? | No advocate |
| **Competition** | Who else? | "No one" |

## MEDDPICC Scorecard

Score each element 1-3:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 (Red) | Unknown or bad |
| 2 (Yellow) | Partial |
| 3 (Green) | Confirmed |

**Total < 12**: High risk
**Total 12-18**: Medium risk
**Total 19-24**: Low risk

# 5. Challenger — Teach, Tailor, Take Control

## Core Principle
**Insight creates differentiation.**

## The Three T's

### 1. Teach
Bring insights they didn't know. Challenge assumptions.

**Not**: "Here's what our product does."
**This**: "Most companies approach [problem] the wrong way. Here's what the best do..."

### 2. Tailor
Customize to stakeholder priorities.

| Stakeholder | Cares About |
|-------------|-------------|
| CEO | Revenue, market position |
| CFO | Costs, ROI, risk |
| VP Sales | Quota, pipeline |
| IT | Integration, security |

### 3. Take Control
Guide the buying process.

**Weak**: "Let me know what you need."
**Strong**: "Based on what you've told me, here's what I recommend..."

## The Challenger Pitch Structure

1. **Warmer**: Connect to acknowledged challenge
2. **Reframe**: Challenge their current approach
3. **Rational Drowning**: Stack up cost of problem
4. **Emotional Impact**: Make it personal
5. **New Way**: Introduce solution approach
6. **Your Solution**: Connect your product
