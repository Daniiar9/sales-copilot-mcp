# Stakeholder Mapping & Multi-Threading

How to identify, map, and engage all the people who influence your deal.

---

## Why Multi-Threading Matters

**Single-threaded deal**: You only talk to one person.
- If they leave → deal dies
- If they get busy → deal stalls
- If they're not the EB → you never close

**Multi-threaded deal**: Relationships across the org.
- Redundancy if someone leaves
- Multiple sources of intel
- Access to real decision-makers

**Rule**: Every deal needs 3+ contacts. Enterprise needs 5+.

## Stakeholder Roles

| Role | Definition | Power |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Economic Buyer (EB)** | Final authority, controls budget | Can say yes |
| **Champion** | Wants you to win, sells internally | Influence |
| **Coach** | Gives insider info | Intel only |
| **Technical Buyer** | Evaluates fit, runs POCs | Can veto |
| **User Buyer** | Will use daily | Can veto |
| **Influencer** | Has the EB's ear | Sway |
| **Blocker** | Against you | Can veto |
| **Ratifier** | Must approve (legal, security) | Can veto |

## Identifying Stakeholders

### Questions to Ask Your Champion

1. "Who else is involved in this decision?"
2. "Who could kill this deal?"
3. "Who controls the budget?"
4. "Who might have concerns?"
5. "Who does [EB] usually consult?"

### Signs by Role

**Economic Buyer signs**:
- Talks about budget without checking others
- Others defer to them
- Asks ROI questions, not feature questions

**Champion signs**:
- Proactively schedules meetings for you
- Shares internal docs
- Warns you about landmines

**Blocker signs**:
- Hard to schedule
- Asks "gotcha" questions
- Brings up past failures
- Delays without clear reasons

## The Buying Committee Matrix

Map each stakeholder on two dimensions:

|                | **Supporter** | **Neutral** | **Opponent** |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| **High Power** | Champion/EB   | Key target  | Blocker 🚨   |
| **Med Power**  | Ally          | Educate     | Neutralize   |
| **Low Power**  | Mobilize      | Ignore      | Monitor      |
