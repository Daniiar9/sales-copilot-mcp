## Dimension 1: Talk Ratio

What percentage did you talk vs. the prospect?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | You talked <30% |
| 4 | You talked 30-40% |
| 3 | You talked 40-50% |
| 2 | You talked 50-60% |
| 1 | You talked >60% |

**Red flags**:
- Monologue pitches
- Answering your own questions
- Cutting them off

**Fix**: Write down your next question and wait until they finish.

---

## Dimension 2: Question Quality

Did you ask strategic, open-ended questions?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | 10+ open questions, strategically sequenced |
| 4 | 7-10 open questions, good depth |
| 3 | 4-6 open questions, some surface-level |
| 2 | Mostly closed/leading questions |
| 1 | Few questions, mostly pitching |

**Good question starters**:
- "Tell me about..."
- "What happens when..."
- "How does that affect..."
- "What would it mean if..."

**Avoid**:
- "Would you say that's a problem?"
- "Don't you think..."
- "Is that right?"

**Power questions**:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "What made you take this call?" | Motivation |
| "What's happening that made this a priority?" | Trigger event |
| "What have you tried before?" | Past attempts |
| "What happens if you don't solve this?" | Implicate pain |
| "Who else cares about this?" | Stakeholder map |

---

## Dimension 3: Pain Discovery

Did you uncover specific, quantified pain?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Specific problem + business impact + personal impact + quantified |
| 4 | Specific problem + business impact + some quantification |
| 3 | Problem identified, but vague impact |
| 2 | Surface symptoms only |
| 1 | No pain uncovered |

**Pain checklist**:

- [ ] Symptom identified
- [ ] Duration known
- [ ] Past attempts explored
- [ ] Business impact quantified
- [ ] Personal impact uncovered
- [ ] Urgency established

**Example of excellent pain discovery**:

"So what I'm hearing is: your month-end close takes 12 days, which means your exec team makes decisions on stale data. You've tried adding headcount but that didn't help. This costs roughly $50K/month in delayed decisions, and you're working weekends. Did I get that right?"

---

## Dimension 4: Listening Quality

Did you actually hear what they said?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Consistently mirrored, labeled emotions, followed threads |
| 4 | Regularly demonstrated listening |
| 3 | Some evidence of listening, missed cues |
| 2 | Minimal engagement |
| 1 | Talked over them, ignored input |

**Listening techniques**:

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Mirroring | "12 days to close..." |
| Labeling | "It sounds like that's frustrating." |
| Summarizing | "So what I'm hearing is..." |
| Following threads | "You mentioned [thing]. Tell me more." |

**Red flags**:
- Ignoring something important
- Asking a question they already answered
- Missing emotional cues

---

## Dimension 5: Stakeholder Discovery

Did you map the decision-making landscape?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Identified EB, decision process, politics |
| 4 | Identified EB and decision process |
| 3 | Asked but didn't go deep |
| 2 | Assumed contact is decision-maker |
| 1 | Didn't ask at all |

**Questions to look for**:
- "Who else is involved?"
- "Who would need to sign off?"
- "How have you made decisions like this before?"
- "Who might have concerns?"

---

## Dimension 6: Next Steps

Did you end with a clear, mutual commitment?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Specific action + owner + date + calendar sent |
| 4 | Specific action + owner + date |
| 3 | General next step agreed |
| 2 | Vague "I'll follow up" |
| 1 | No next step |

**Strong next step**:
"I'll send the proposal by Friday. You'll review with [EB] next week. We'll reconvene on the 15th at 2pm. Sending calendar invite now."

**Weak next step**:
"I'll send some info and follow up next week."

---

## Dimension 7: Objection Handling

How did you respond to resistance?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Acknowledged, probed root cause, addressed, confirmed |
| 4 | Acknowledged and addressed |
| 3 | Addressed surface without probing |
| 2 | Dismissed or argued |
| 1 | Ignored or got defensive |

**Good flow**:
1. Pause
2. Acknowledge ("I hear you")
3. Probe ("Tell me more")
4. Address root cause
5. Confirm ("Does that help?")

---

## Dimension 8: Methodology Application

Did you apply sales frameworks?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Multiple frameworks applied fluidly |
| 4 | 1-2 frameworks applied well |
| 3 | Some methodology, inconsistent |
| 2 | Mentioned but not executed |
| 1 | No methodology evident |

**What to look for**:

| Framework | Signs |
|-----------|-------|
| Braun | Made it safe to say no, detached |
| Voss | Mirrored, labeled, calibrated questions |
| Sandler | Pain funnel, up-front contract |
| MEDDPICC | Covered metrics, EB, decision process |
| Challenger | Taught something new, reframed |

## Self-Coaching Questions

After every call, answer:

1. What did I learn about their situation?
2. What pain did I uncover? How quantified?
3. Who else is involved in this decision?
4. What objections came up? Did I get to root cause?
5. What's the specific next step?
6. What would I do differently?
